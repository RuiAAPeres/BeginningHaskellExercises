--- â€¢ How many different ways can you find to write allEven?

allEven :: [Int] -> Bool
allEven [] = True
allEven (x:xs) = even x && allEven xs

allEven' :: [Int] -> Bool
allEven' = and . map (even)

allEven'' :: [Int] -> Bool
allEven'' = foldr (&&) True . map (even)

--- â€¢ Write a function that takes a list and returns the same list in reverse.

reverse' :: [a] -> [a]
reverse' [] = []
reverse' (x:xs) = reverse' xs ++ [x]
